## Test

1. Write a function that receives 2 Date parameters and returns the time
difference in minutes.

2. Write a function that reverses a given (as a parameter) string

3. Write a function that combines two arrays by alternatingly taking their
elements in, e.g. [x,y,z], [10,20,30] prints [x,10,y,20,z,30] .

4. Write a function that prints the description of the previous number in a
sequence of numbers, use two parameters, the first is the number to start the
sequence and the second the number of iterations to show after the first
number.

For example: sayWhatYouSee(1, 5) the result prints out:
1
11
21
1211
111221
312211

5. Write a function that receives n (a number) as a parameter and prints all
valid (properly opened and closed) combinations of n-pairs of parentheses.
// Input: 3
// Output: ((())), (()()), (())(), ()(()), ()()()

6. Write a function which will receive an hour and minute from an analog clock,
and calculate the inner angle between them.

7. Given a number between 0 and 1 (e.g. 0.15), print its binary representation. If
the number cannot be represented accurately in binary with at most 32
characters, just print "Error".
